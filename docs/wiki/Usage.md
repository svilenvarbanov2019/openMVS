Next a usage example of the available modules is presented. For this we used the [Sceaux Castle](https://github.com/openMVG/ImageDataset_SceauxCastle) images and [OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG) pipeline to recover camera positions and the sparse point-cloud. All output presented here is the original output obtained automatically by the `OpenMVS` pipeline, with no manual manipulation of the results. Pre-built binaries for Windows x64 (with and without CUDA), Ubuntu x64 and macOS arm64 are attached to every tagged release on the [OpenMVS releases page](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/releases/latest).

All `OpenMVS` binaries support some command line parameters, which are explained in detail if executed with no parameters or with `-h`.

@FlachyJoe contributed with a [script](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/blob/master/MvgMvsPipeline.py) which automates the process of running `OpenMVG` and `OpenMVS` in a single command line. Same results as below can be obtained by running:

```
python MvgMvsPipeline.py <images_folder> <output_folder>
```
On some Linux distributions, Python 3 must be specified to run the script successfully, this can be done by running:

```
python3 MvgMvsPipeline.py <images_folder> <output_folder>
```
Option can be passed to command lines to change default settings in each step as follows:

```
python3 MvgMvsPipeline.py <images_folder> <output_folder> --1 p HIGH n 8 --2 n ANNL2
```
Where --1 refer to the first step (openMVG_main_ComputeFeatures),p refers to describerPreset option which HIGH was chosen, and n refers to numThreads which 8 was used. The second step indicated by --2 refers to openMVG_main_ComputeMatches,n refers to nearest_matching_method option which ANNL2 was chosen.

For more information, invoke -h option as follows:
```
python3 MvgMvsPipeline.py -h
```

## Extract Keyframes from a Video

When starting from video (for example a 360° tour, a drone flyover, or any hand-held capture), the `ExtractKeyframes` module selects a stable, well-spaced subset of frames and writes them out together with an initial calibration as a native `.sfm` project:

```
ExtractKeyframes -i input.mp4 -o scene.sfm -d keyframes
```

![extracted keyframes](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_keyframes.jpg)

Notable options:

- `--overlap-threshold` (default `0.85`) — minimum feature-overlap kept between two consecutive keyframes.
- `--detector-type` (`SIFT` | `AKAZE` | `ORB` | `SIFTGPU`, default `SIFT`) — feature detector used for the overlap estimation.
- `--focal-length` (default `0`, auto-calibrate) — known focal length in pixels; the module will auto-calibrate from the fundamental matrices when left at `0`.
- `--camera-type` (`0` pinhole, `1` spherical, default `0`) — set to `1` for equirectangular 360° video.
- `--cubemap-faces` (`4`, `6`, `8`, `12` or `20`, default `6`) — number of tangent-pinhole faces used internally for feature extraction on spherical frames.
- `--blur-size` (default `0`, disabled) — Gaussian kernel applied to the optical-flow image to reject motion-blurred frames.
- `--refine-calibration` (`0` disabled, `1` two-view, `2` three-view, `3` view-graph; default `3`) — level of intrinsic refinement performed during matching.

## Sparse Reconstruction with Native SfM

From either the keyframes produced above or any folder / semicolon-separated list of still images, the `CreateStructure` module performs a full incremental SfM and writes a sparse reconstruction. The `--export-mvs` option additionally writes a ready-to-consume `.mvs` project for the downstream dense-reconstruction step:

```
CreateStructure -s images_folder -o scene.sfm --export-mvs scene.mvs
```

![native sparse reconstruction](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_sparse.jpg)

Notable options:

- `--detector-type` (default `SIFTGPU`) — feature detector; same choices as above.
- `--match-mode` (`-1` skip, `0` exhaustive, `1` vocabulary, `2` sequential; default `1`) — pairwise-matching strategy.
- `--match-sequence-overlap` (default `3`) — sequence overlap when using sequential matching.
- `--vocab-max-pairs` (default `50`) — maximum pairs per image for vocabulary-tree matching.
- `--import-poses-csv` (default `poses.csv`) with `--import-poses-mode` (`0` none, `1` all, `2` extrinsics only, `3` positions only) — seed the reconstruction from a CSV of known poses.
- `--export-poses-csv` — write the recovered poses alongside the scene.
- `--import-openmvg-dir` / `--export-openmvg-dir` — interoperate with OpenMVG feature files.
- `--focal-length` (default `0`, disabled) and `--default-focal-ratio` (default `1.2`, used as `ratio * max(width,height)` when the focal length is unknown) — intrinsic overrides.
- `--extract-colors` (default `false`) — attach image colors to the reconstructed sparse points.

## End-to-End Pipeline: Video → Textured Mesh

A complete reconstruction starting from a 360° video file:

```
ExtractKeyframes -i pano.mp4 -o scene.sfm -d frames --camera-type 1
CreateStructure -s frames -o scene.sfm --export-mvs scene.mvs
DensifyPointCloud scene.mvs
ReconstructMesh scene_dense.mvs -p scene_dense.ply
TextureMesh scene_dense.mvs -m scene_dense_mesh.ply
```

![spherical reconstruction result](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_spherical_dense.jpg)

Equirectangular images and video are supported end-to-end: the SfM stage processes them natively, and the downstream MVS modules receive an automatic six-face cube-map projection — no manual flat-panorama unwrapping is needed.

## Convert SfM scene from `OpenMVG`

After all camera views are calibrated and stitched, `OpenMVG` will generate by default the `sfm_data.bin` file containing camera poses and the sparse point-cloud. Using the exporter tool provided by `OpenMVG`, we convert it to the `OpenMVS` project `scene.mvs`:

```
openMVG_main_openMVG2openMVS -i sfm_data.bin -o scene.mvs -d scene_undistorted_images
```

The directory made with the -d switch will store the undistorted images. 

## Convert SfM scene from `COLMAP`

After `COLMAP` finishes calibrating and stitching the input images, the undistorted cameras and images must be created:
```
colmap image_undistorter --image_path <images_path> --input_path sparse/0 --output_path dense --output_type COLMAP
```
The undistorted camera poses and images, plus the sparse point-cloud generated by `COLMAP` can be imported by `OpenMVS` into project `scene.mvs`:

```
InterfaceCOLMAP -i dense -o scene.mvs --image-folder dense/images
```

## Convert SfM scene from `Metashape` / `iTwin Capture Modeler` and `Polycam`

`OpenMVS` has importers for other well known SfM solutions, like `Metashape` (aka `Photoscan`) / `iTwin Capture Modeler` (aka `ContextCapture`) using the BlocksExchange format, and `Polycam` using the raw export scene.

## Convert SfM scene from any other format

`OpenMVS` can process any scene, calibrated by any Structure-from-Motion solver, as long as it receives as input the camera poses, the sparse point-cloud and the corresponding undistorted images. All that needs to be done is to store this information in the `MVS` file format as described in [Interface.h](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/blob/master/libs/MVS/Interface.h) header file. This file is stand-alone, and can be copied as it is in the SfM solver code and use it directly to export the data in `MVS` format.

A typical sparse point-cloud and camera poses obtained by the previous steps will look like this:

![sparse point-cloud](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/Sparse.jpg)

`Viewer` module can be used to visualize any `MVS` project file or `PLY`/`OBJ` file. The viewer expects the input file either on the command line or to drag & drop it inside the viewer window. `Viewer` is used to create all the screenshots below.

The output of each `OpenMVS` module is displayed by default both on the console and stored in a `LOG` file. Example of the generated `LOG` files can also be found at [OpenMVS_sample](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample).

## Dense Point-Cloud Reconstruction (optional)

If scene parts are missing, the dense reconstruction module can recover them by estimating a dense point-cloud, employing by default a Patch-Match approach:

```
DensifyPointCloud scene.mvs
```

The obtained dense point-cloud (please note the vertex colors are roughly estimated only for visualization, they do not contribute farther down the pipeline):

![dense point-cloud](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_dense.jpg)

The densification module stores, along the dense scene in `MVS` format, also the depth-maps for every processed image in `DMAP` format. `Viewer` module can be used to visualize the `DMAP` files and export them as `PLY` point-clouds.

![dense point-cloud](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/depth0001.dmap.jpg)

## Dense Point-Cloud Reconstruction using Semi-Global Matching (optional)

Alternatively, the dense reconstruction module can estimate a dense point-cloud using Semi-Global Matching (SGM), in two steps: fist estimating disparity-maps between all valid image pairs, followed by a second step fusing them in the final point-cloud:

```
DensifyPointCloud scene.mvs --fusion-mode -1
DensifyPointCloud scene.mvs --fusion-mode -2
```

## Dense Point-Cloud Reconstruction using available depth-maps (optional)

The densification module can skip depth-maps estimation if these are known for certain images. In order to use pre-computed depth-maps, all you need to do is to store them in `depthXXXX.dmap` files, where `XXXX` is the ID of the image, using the very simple/portable format explained in [Interface.h](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS/blob/master/libs/MVS/Interface.h#L631). Once depth-maps exported as `DMAP` files, simply run `DensifyPointCloud` as usual, and it will only estimate missing depth-maps, and continue by fusing them in a dense point-cloud.

## Rough Mesh Reconstruction

The sparse or dense point-cloud obtained in the previous steps is used as the input of the mesh reconstruction module:

```
ReconstructMesh scene_dense.mvs -p scene_dense.ply
```

The obtained mesh:

![rough mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_dense_mesh.jpg)

## Mesh Refinement (optional)

The mesh obtained either from the sparse or dense point-cloud can be further refined to recover all fine details or even bigger missing parts. Next the rough mesh obtained only from the sparse point-cloud is refined:

```
RefineMesh scene.mvs -m scene_mesh.ply -o scene_dense_mesh_refine.mvs
```

The mesh before and after refinement:

![rough mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_mesh.jpg)
![refined mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_mesh_refine.jpg)

Similarly, the rough mesh obtained from the dense point-cloud can be refined:

```
RefineMesh scene_dense.mvs -m scene_dense_mesh.ply -o scene_dense_mesh_refine.mvs --scales 1 --max-face-area 16
```

The mesh before and after refinement:

![rough mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_dense_mesh.jpg)
![refined mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_dense_mesh_refine.jpg)
## Mesh Texturing

The mesh obtained in the previous steps is used as the input of the mesh texturing module:

```
TextureMesh scene_dense.mvs -m scene_dense_mesh_refine.ply -o scene_dense_mesh_refine_texture.mvs
```

The obtained mesh plus texture:

![textured mesh](https://github.com/cdcseacave/openMVS_sample/blob/master/scene_dense_mesh_refine_texture.jpg)

Note that the triangles textured in orange (default) are not visible in any of the input images, and can be colored differently or removed.

## Exporting and Viewing Results

Each of the above commands also writes a `PLY` file that can be used with many third-party tools. Alternatively, `Viewer` can be used to export the `MVS` projects to `PLY` or `OBJ` formats.

### The Viewer App

The `Viewer` is a full-featured interactive GUI for inspecting, editing and exporting OpenMVS projects. It doubles as a hub from which the MVS pipeline can be launched step-by-step on the currently loaded scene.

#### Launching

```
Viewer [--input-file|-i] scene.mvs
```

The input file (or any of the supported formats listed below) can be passed on the command line or dragged and dropped onto the viewer window at any time.

**Supported input formats:** `.mvs` (native scene), `.sfm` (native SfM project), `.dmap` (single depth-map), `.ply`, `.obj`, `.gltf`, `.glb`.

**Viewer-specific CLI options:**

- `--input-file, -i` — project file containing cameras and geometry.
- `--geometry-file, -g` — external mesh or point-cloud that overlays / replaces the scene geometry.
- `--output-file, -o` — output filename for programmatic mesh export.
- `--export-type` — export format override (`ply` or `obj`).
- `--max-memory` — hard memory cap in MB (`0` = unlimited).

#### GUI

The user interface is built on Dear ImGui and organized into menus, dockable panels and overlays:

- **File menu** — Open / Save / Save As / Close / Export, plus screenshot capture (with or without UI visible).
- **View menu** — toggles Scene Info, Camera Info, Camera Controls, Selection, Render Settings, Bounding Box, Console and the Performance / Workflow / Viewport / Selection overlays.
- **Render toggles** — one-key switches for Point-cloud, Mesh, Cameras, Wireframe, Textured, and Bounding-box visibility.
- **Workflow menu** — launches the OpenMVS pipeline steps on the loaded scene: *Estimate ROI*, *Densify*, *Reconstruct Mesh*, *Refine*, *Texture*. Each opens a parameter panel with the corresponding module's options.
- **Help / About dialogs** — `F1` shows the complete in-app keybinding reference.

#### Mouse controls

The viewer supports two navigation modes, switched with `Tab`:

- **Arcball mode** (default) — left-drag rotates around the focus point, middle-drag (or `Ctrl` + scroll) pans, scroll-wheel zooms.
- **First-person mode** — `W` / `A` / `S` / `D` move the camera, left-drag looks around, scroll adjusts movement speed.

In **selection mode** (`G`), left-drag performs a rectangle pick and a single left-click selects or deselects points or faces — selected vertex indices are printed to the console. In the **bounding-box editor** (`Shift+B`) the 8 corner handles, 6 face handles and 3 rotation rings can be dragged directly in the viewport to resize, translate and orient the region of interest.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

File & app
- `Ctrl+O` open · `Ctrl+S` save · `Ctrl+Shift+S` save as · `Ctrl+X` screenshot · `F11` fullscreen · `ESC` close window · `F1` help

Navigation
- `Tab` switch arcball ↔ first-person · `R` reset view · `←` / `→` step to previous / next camera pose

Display toggles
- `P` point cloud · `M` mesh · `C` cameras · `W` wireframe · `T` textured · `B` bounding box

Panels (Shift + letter)
- `Shift+A` Scene Info · `Shift+Q` Camera Info · `Shift+C` Camera Controls · `Shift+S` Selection · `Shift+R` Render Settings · `Shift+B` Bounding-Box editor

Tools
- `G` toggle selection mode · `Ctrl+B` run ROI estimation

#### Headline features

- **ROI editing.** Press `Shift+B` to overlay an interactive oriented bounding box on the scene; drag the corner, face or rotation handles to define the region that subsequent pipeline stages will focus on. ROI can also be auto-estimated from the scene (`Ctrl+B`) or loaded from a file.
- **Camera trajectory colouring.** Camera frustums are coloured along a Jet colormap according to their index in the capture sequence — blue at the start, red at the end — making it easy to spot loop closures, gaps or ordering issues. Cameras can be rendered as full frustums or as simple dots; the currently selected camera and its neighbours are highlighted distinctly.
- **Camera-pose navigation.** The left / right arrow keys step through the scene's registered views; `Shift+Q` pins a panel showing the selected camera's intrinsics and extrinsics.
- **Depth-map inspection.** Load a `.dmap` file directly (command-line, `Ctrl+O` or drag-and-drop) to render the depth map as a coloured 3D surface; the viewer also exports depth maps to `.ply` for use in external tools.
- **In-GUI pipeline.** The *Workflow* menu launches `DensifyPointCloud`, `ReconstructMesh`, `RefineMesh` and `TextureMesh` on the loaded scene without leaving the viewer, with the result live-reloaded once each step completes.
- **Export.** `File ▸ Export...` opens a dialog that writes the current point-cloud and/or mesh to `.ply`, `.obj` or `.glb`; the format can also be forced with the `--export-type` CLI override. Screenshots can be captured to `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jxl` with `Ctrl+X`.
